### App Walkthrough | Running 'Curb C-19' For The First Time 
#### > Dashboard UI 
We focused on the principle of _Minimalism_. Built this up on Googleâ€™s Material Design Library which helps the UI look easy and seamless keeping and all in all adds up to enhancing the appâ€™s design / user interface experience. Why don't you see for yourself?
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Dashboard (1/3)</th>
    <th>Dashboard (2/3)</th>
    <th>Dashboard (3/3)
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/reachvivek/Curb-C19/blob/master/walkthrough/20200415_052953.gif"/></td>

#### > Key Features 
Can't appearances be deceptive? That's what we thought! So here's an insight into some few extra dives that this app manages to pull of which also makes it fully fledged in its own way. Also, didn't you love the _Night Mode_ ? **Well, _Suit yourself_...**
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Paginated Information</th>
    <th>Search FAQs | Toggle Between Night Mode / Light Mode</th>
    <th>Curated Helpline Numbers
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td><img src="https://github.com/reachvivek/Curb-C19/blob/master/walkthrough/20200415_062632.gif"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### > Proposed Features
There are also a few certain things we are proposing as an idea after considering some of the recent **activities and violations** of the lockdown protocol in day light during this pandemic hour. What do you think? _Do let us know..._
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Request To Go Out</th>
    <th>Report Violation</th>
    <th>AI Chatbot
  </tr>
